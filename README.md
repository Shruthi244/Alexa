# Alexa
Created own alexa which can answer any questions
Here I have used some python libraries for training my alexa.I have imported speech recognition,google-search,pywhatkit,pyjokes libraries.Then I trained alexa with simple questions.It takes input from the user through microphone and act accordingly.
